   The Mesa distribution consists of several components. Different
   copyrights and licenses apply to different components. For
   example, GLUT is copyrighted by Mark Kilgard, some demo programs
   are copyrighted by SGI, some of the Mesa device drivers are
   copyrighted by their authors. See below for a list of Mesa's
   components and the copyright/license for each.

   The core Mesa library is licensed according to the terms of the
   XFree86 copyright (an MIT-style license). This allows integration
   with the XFree86/DRI project. Unless otherwise stated, the Mesa
   source code and documentation is licensed as follows:

   When contributing to the Mesa project you must agree to relinquish
   your work to the holder of the copyright for the particular
   component you're contributing to. That is, you can't put your own
   copyright on the code, unless it's a modular piece that can be
   omitted from Mesa (like a new device driver). If for example, you
   contribute a bug fix to Mesa's texture mapping code, your code
   will become a part of the body of work which is copyrighted by

2.  License Grant and Restrictions.

2.1. SGI License Grant. Subject to the terms of this License and any
     third party intellectual property claims, for the duration of
     intellectual property protections inherent in the Original Code,
     SGI hereby grants Recipient a worldwide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license, to do the following: (i) under copyrights
     Licensable by SGI, to reproduce, distribute, create derivative
     works from, and, to the extent applicable, display and perform the
     Original Code and/or any Modifications provided by SGI alone and/or
     as part of a Larger Work; and (ii) under any Licensable Patents, to
     make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and/or otherwise
     transfer the Original Code and/or any Modifications provided by
     SGI. Recipient accepts the terms and conditions of this License by
     undertaking any of the aforementioned actions. The patent license
     shall apply to the Covered Code if, at the time any related
     Modification is added, such addition of the Modification causes
     such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent
     license in Section 2.1(ii) shall not apply to any other
     combinations that include the Modification. No patent license is
     provided under SGI Patents for infringements of SGI Patents by
     Modifications not provided by SGI or combinations of Original Code
     and Modifications not provided by SGI.

2.2. Recipient License Grant. Subject to the terms of this License and
     any third party intellectual property claims, Recipient hereby
     grants SGI and any other Recipients a worldwide, royalty-free,
     non-exclusive license, under any Recipient Patents, to make, have
     made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and/or otherwise transfer
     the Original Code and/or any Modifications provided by SGI.

2.3. No License For Hardware Implementations. The licenses granted in
     Section 2.1 and 2.2 are not applicable to implementation in
     Hardware of the algorithms embodied in the Original Code or any
     Modifications provided by SGI .

3.  Redistributions. 

3.1. Retention of Notice/Copy of License. The Notice set forth in
     Exhibit A, below, must be conspicuously retained or included in any
     and all redistributions of Covered Code. For distributions of the
     Covered Code in source code form, the Notice must appear in every
     file that can include a text comments field; in executable form,
     the Notice and a copy of this License must appear in related
     documentation or collateral where the Recipient’s rights relating
     to Covered Code are described. Any Additional Notice Provisions
     which actually appears in the Original Code must also be retained
     or included in any and all redistributions of Covered Code.

3.2. Alternative License. Provided that Recipient is in compliance with
     the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without
     derogation of any of SGI’s rights in and to the Original Code,
     distribute the source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered
     Code under (1) this License; (2) a license identical to this
     License but for only such changes as are necessary in order to
     clarify Recipient’s role as licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a
     license of Recipient’s choosing, containing terms different from
     this License, provided that the license terms include this Section
     3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms may not be
     modified or superseded by any other terms of such license. If
     Recipient elects to use any license other than this License,
     Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of its terms which
     differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, and not by
     SGI. It is emphasized that this License is a limited license, and,
     regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in accordance
     with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only such rights, in
     Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has actually been
     granted by SGI in this License.

3.3. Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any
     liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative
     license terms Recipient offers.

4.  Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
    terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and
    fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to 
    the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any
    termination of this License, absent termination by the terms of such
    sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect
    beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.

5.  No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights
    to: (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any
    other rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by
    implication, estoppel or otherwise with respect to the Covered Code;
    (ii) any trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever, including
    without limitation any related right for purposes of endorsement or
    promotion of products derived from the Covered Code, without prior
    written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title to or ownership of the
    Original Code, which shall at all times remains with SGI. All rights
    in the Original Code not expressly granted under this License are
    reserved.

6.  Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various worldwide
    laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions
    of Covered Code, including without limitation export, re-export, and
    import control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S.
    government and other countries, and Recipient is reminded it is
    obliged to obey such laws, regulations, and executive orders.
    Recipient may not distribute Covered Code that (i) in any way
    infringes (directly or contributorily) any intellectual property
    rights of any kind of any other person or entity or (ii) breaches
    any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, to
    which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have been
    subject.

7.  Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim
    that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or
    partially infringes the third party's intellectual property rights,
    Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.

8.  Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions
    of the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version
    number. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular
    version of the License, Recipient may, for the duration of the
    license, continue to use it under the terms of that version, or
    choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
    version published by SGI. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3
    and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to
    Covered Code created under this License.

9.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS." ALL
    EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS ARE DISCLAIMED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS
    OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SGI ASSUMES NO RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
    AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE
    IN ANY RESPECT, SGI ASSUMES NO COST OR LIABILITY FOR SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY IS AN ESSENTIAL
    PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
    HEREUNDER EXCEPT SUBJECT TO THIS DISCLAIMER.

10.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES NOR LEGAL THEORY,
     WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
     LIABILITY), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL SGI OR ANY SGI LICENSOR
     BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
     LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOSS OF
     DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
     RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
     THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.

11.  Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages
     arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights
     under this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold
     harmless Silicon Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss,
     liability, damages, costs or expenses (including the payment of
     reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of Recipient's use,
     modification, reproduction and distribution of the Covered Code or
     out of any representation or warranty made by Recipient.

12.  U.S. Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item"
     consisting of "commercial computer software" as such terms are
     defined in title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations and all U.S.
     Government End Users acquire only the rights set forth in this
     License and are subject to the terms of this License.

13.  Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement
     concerning the its subject matter. If any provision of this License
     is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed so as
     to achieve as nearly as possible the same legal and economic effect
     as the original provision and the remainder of this License will
     remain in effect. This License shall be governed by and construed
     in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of
     California as applied to agreements entered into and to be
     performed entirely within California between California residents.
     Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
     exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
     District of California (or, absent subject matter jurisdiction in
     such courts, the courts of the State of California), with venue
     lying exclusively in Santa Clara County, California, with the
     losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
     court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
     application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
     International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
     regulation that provides that the language of a contract shall be
     construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
