  * Merge patch from Pino Tiscano (thanks!):
    - Use hurd-any instead of: hurd-i386 (“wildcard archs are free”).
    - Use any-i386 instead of: i386 kfreebsd-i386 hurd-i386.
    - Rewrite a check in debian/rules to follow the same logic.
    - Switch libgbm1-dbg to arch: linux-any. This fixes uninstallability
      on kfreebsd-* by getting rid of this package there.
    - Switch libglapi-mesa{,-dbg} arch: any. This fixes the FTBFS on
      hurd-i386^Wany.

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * debian/libopenvg1-mesa-dev.links.in:

    - Make linking against libGL in libgl1-mesa-swx11-dev actually work.  This
      seems to have been broken since Ubuntu 10.04 without complaint, so it's
      fairly clear that no-one actually uses this package.

  * New upstream snapshot, from the master branch (up to 2fe39b46e7).
  * Drop 05_hurd-ftbfs.diff, merged upstream (as 758561786c).
  * Refresh 06_kfreebsd-ftbfs.diff (due to 8fd8de3995).
  * Refresh 08-kfreebsd-gallium.diff (adjust offsets).
  * Add 10-hurd-configure-tweaks.diff to enable x86 assembler on Hurd,
    thanks to Pino Toscano.
  * Refresh 11-hurd-ftbfs-again.diff (adjust offsets and drop the
    src/gallium/auxiliary/os/os_time.c hunk, which should be OK since
    PIPE_OS_UNIX is used there, and should happily replace the use of
    PIPE_OS_HURD; and adapt for the removal of the PIPE_OS_EMBEDDED check).
  * debian/libegl1-mesa.install.in: Stop trying to install egl_dri2.so and
    egl_glx.so, since they are now built-in (since c98ea26e16).
  * debian/libgles{1,2}-mesa.install.in: Stop trying to install
    st_GLESv{1,2}_CM.so (respectively), which got removed. Quoting the
    commit message: “Remove GLES overlay. With core mesa doing runtime API
    checks, GLES overlay is no longer needed.” (12583174c5).
  * Drop --enable-gles-overlay from debian/rules accordingly.
  * Add 12-llvm-config-check.diff to handle --disable-gallium more
    properly.
  * Add 13-llvm-config-pick-a-version.diff, so that llvm-config-2.9 is
    searched by configure, instead of unversioned llvm-config.
  * Add a NOT_INSTALLED_EITHER variable to debian/not-installed. A few
    files might have to be removed, but only if that's a git snapshot
    (those files aren't in the released tarballs). Let's consider it's OK
    to run “rm -f” on them: {,dri/}usr/include/GL/glut{,f90}.h
  * Add libglapi-mesa{,-dbg} packages.
  * Use a package-name-doesnt-match-sonames override accordingly.
  * Update libegl1-mesa.symbols with new symbols.
  * Update libgles{1,2}-mesa.symbols now that internal symbols (_glapi_*
    and _glthread_GetID) moved to libglapi-mesa.
  * Add a gentarball target, to generate tarballs for git snapshots.
  * Replace “The OpenGL utility library…” with “Mesa OpenGL utility
    library…” in the description of the libglu1-mesa* packages.
  * Replace radeon with r300 in GALLIUM_DRIVERS to match upstream renaming
    (5722286be2).
  * Build r300 classic (through DRI_DRIVERS) everywhere, since r300g comes
    with a few additional requirements: LLVM is needed for this driver,
    and apparently only works fine on x86 platform. As a consequence, only
    build r300g on amd and i386, and add llvm-2.9-dev build-dep on those
    platforms accordingly. Disable it explicitly on other platforms.
  * Stop building i915g at all, it's apparently never going to be a
    suitable replacement for i915c.
  * Add libwayland-dev build-dep.
  * Add wayland to EGL_DISPLAYS on Linux.
  * Ship wayland-egl.pc and libwayland-egl.so in libegl1-mesa-dev; and ship
    libwayland-egl.so.1* in libegl1-mesa-drivers.
  * Update libegl1-mesa.symbols with new wl_drm_interface symbol.

  * Update symbols files with new symbols:
    - libopenvg1-mesa.symbols
  * Remove “mesa internal ASM optimized functions” lines from symbols
    files, those seem to be gone, and with -c4 passed to dpkg-gensymbols,
    any related issue will break the build:

    - libgles2-mesa.symbols
  * Stop using dh_strip -s --remaining-packages. When a build is resumed
    (-nc), this dh_strip call is a no-op if it was previously written to
    the debhelper log files. Specify all remaining packages instead.
    That's boring, but avoid getting non-stripped packages.

  * Merge from Debian experimental.  Remaining Ubuntu changes:
   - debian/control
      + Drop lesstif-dev from Build-Depends; it's in Universe.
      + Comment out GLw libs since it depends on lesstif-dev.
      + Drop i686 swx11 libgl package.
      + Add libdrm-dev to mesa-common-dev Depends.
    - debian/rules
      + Unexport LDFLAGS (amd64 FTBFS).
      + Use --disable-glw for swx11 targets too.
      + Don't enable motif for swx11 targets.
      + Use lzma compression for binary debs to save CD space.
      + Drop unloved mach64 driver.
    - debian/patches
      + 100_no_abi_tag.patch
      + 101_ubuntu_hidden_glname.patch
      + 103_savage-expose_fbmodes_with_nonzero_alpha.patch
      + 104_i915_fragment_shader_disable.patch:
        - Disable the (experimental) ARB_fragment_shader option by default
  	  on i915, which breaks KDE compositing (LP 628930).
      + 107_glxgears_is_not_a_benchmark.patch
    - rules, libgl1-mesa-{glx,dev,swx11,swx11-dev}.install,
      libgl1-mesa-{glx,swx11}.{postinst,prerm}, libgl1-mesa-dev.links:
      Install libGL.so* in /usr/lib/mesa to allow things to work with
      alternatives.
    - debian/gbp.conf
      + Point at Ubuntu branch to make git-buildpackage less narky.
  * Drop 107_glxgears_is_not_a_benchmark.patch.  Demos have been moved out to
    the mesa-demos package.
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/libgl1-mesa-dri.install:
    - Install both r300c/r300g and r600c/r600g, renaming the non-default
      r300c to r300c_dri.so and r600g to r600g_dri.so to avoid conflicts.
      The radeon DDX will get a patch to select between these appropriately.
  * debian/patches/105_use_shared_libdricore.patch:
  * debian/rules:
  * debian/libgl1-mesa-dri.install

      against it.  Shaves about 30MiB of disc space off the DRI drivers.
  * debian/control:
    - Add libudev-dev to build-depends.  This is requried for the DRI2 EGL
      driver to work with a drm display.
  * debian/control:
    - Build classic nouveau_vieux DRI driver, and install in libgl1-mesa-dri.
      this is no less stable than other DRI drivers we ship there.

mesa (7.9-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * debian/control:
    - Add EGL, GLESv1, GLESv2, and OpenVG virtual packages.  The Khronos group
      specifies a de-facto linux ABI for these libraries.  We have a similar
      package for libgl1.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    - Document the virtual packages above.

  [ Sven Joachim ]
  * Bump libdrm-dev build dependency to 2.4.21-2~, the Nouveau Gallium
    driver does not build with squeeze's libdrm-nouveau1.

  [ Julien Cristau ]
  * New upstream release.
  * Update patches:
    - 03_optional-progs-and-install.patch dropped, demos moved to a separate
      package
    - 07-nouveau-update.diff and
      09-intel-fix-invalidate-before-initialisation.diff dropped, they were
      backports from upstream
    - 04_osmesa_version.diff updated
  * Add build-dep on talloc.
  * Drop the mesa-utils package, demos were moved out of the mesa tree.
  * Use --with-egl-platforms instead of --with-egl-displays, and replace kms
    with drm.
  * Merge some packaging changes from ubuntu:
    - libegl1-mesa-drivers-x11,kms: There are no longer separate kms or x11
      drivers for EGL, libegl1-mesa-drivers now contains a single driver that
      provides both backends (Christopher James Halse Rogers)
    - Remove pre-generated .pc's, use the ones generated at build time instead
      (Robert Hooker)
    - Build the r600 gallium driver
    - Update symbols files
  * README.source: we don't need to repack MesaLib.tar.gz anymore.
  * Kill old sourceforge url from debian/watch.
  * Ship the gallium r300 driver instead of the classic one.

  * Cherry-pick b24238c4 from 7.9 release branch.  Fixes the lookup of

mesa (7.9~git20100909-0ubuntu2) maverick; urgency=low

  * 105_old_gc_ignore_destroyed_drawable_events.patch (revert),
    106_old_gc_fix_use_after_free.patch (revert),
    107_old_gc_drop_broken_drawable_garbage_collector.patch (revert):
    These three related patches introduced a new garbage collector, however
    this introduces a regression causing clutter/mutter/unity to load with
    a blank white screen.  Revert these three patches to restore mesa to
    a working condition for unity.

  [ Robert Hooker ]
  * Adjust the build system to install the dri target in a separate
    DESTDIR, no longer passing --libdir=/usr/lib/glx at configure time
    messing with the .pc's since it is used for a majority of the 
    packages now.
  * Fix up the mesa-common-dev header install location.

  * Add ${misc:Depends} to all packages.
  * libc6-dev is build-essential, no need to depend on it.

    dependency on libxt-dev and lesstif2-dev.
  * Add new lintian overrides for the package-name-doesnt-match-sonames stuff.
  * Don't ship progs/objviewer in the tarball, it's insanely big and unused.
  * New upstream release.
  * Refresh patches.
  * Stop shipping an upstream git log, it's unlikely to be useful to anyone,
    and it's big.
  * debian/scripts/choose-configs: use DEB_HOST_ARCH, not DEB_BUILD_ARCH
    (closes: #451648).
  * Rename radeong_dri.so to r300_dri.so in build, not binary.

  [ Christopher James Halse Rogers ]
  * debian/patches/07-nouveau-update.diff:
    - Pull in nouveau_class.h header no longer shipped by libdrm 2.4.21 and 
      update nouveau build to use it.  Fixes FTBFS against libdrm 2.4.21.
  * debian/rules:
    - Simplify selecting which gallium drivers are built.  Use this to only
      act on gallium packages on archs where we're actually building them.
      Part of the fix for FTBFS on Hurd and kFreeBSD.

  * Make libgl1-mesa-dev and mesa-common-dev 'Architecture: any'.  This gets
    rid of uninstallability when a new upstream version isn't built on all
    architectures, and allows us to ship potentially arch-specific .pc files.
  * Install pkgconfig files for libGLU, libOSMesa and libGLw.
  * Make libgl1-mesa-dri{,-dbg} 'Architecture: any', as swrast_dri.so should
    get built everywhere.
  * Drop the dependency on libgl1-mesa-glx from -dri, and make -glx recommend
    -dri instead.  The dri drivers are also loaded by the X server, which
    doesn't need libGL.  On the other hand, libGL needs one of the dri drivers
    for direct rendering (either software or hardware).  Mark libgl1-mesa-dri
    as breaking old xserver-xorg-core and libgl1-mesa-glx, to avoid
    incompatibilities.
  * Add patch by Samuel Thibault to fix FTBFS on hurd-i386.

mesa (6.5.1-0.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Rewrote the debian/rules file to make it easier to understand.
  * Provide i686 optimized versions in libgl1-mesa-swx11-i686 instead of in
    libgl1-mesa-swx11.
  * Statically link libOSMesa with the software rasterization code from libGL
    so that it works independently of the installed libGL. (Closes: #387706)
  * Make libosmesa6-dev depend on mesa-common-dev because it only needs the
    gl.h header file and no libGL anymore.
  * Move glx*.h headers from libgl1-mesa(-swx11)-dev into mesa-common-dev
    because both packages provide identical files.
  * Add debugging symbol packages for libgl1-mesa-swx11, libgl1-mesa-glx and
    libgl1-mesa-dri.
  * Repack the contents of the three Mesa tarballs (MesaDemos, MesaGLUT and
    MesaLib) as the original source tarball. (Closes: #392715)
  * Make mesa-common-dev depend on libx11-dev.
  * Provide a new package: mesa-utils. These utilities are shipped in the
    MesaDemos package so mesa is the right package to provide them.

  * New upstream version
  * Build-dep on x11proto-gl-dev >= 1.4.8
  * Stuff not in the upstream tarballs
    + os2 glut stuff
    + docs/gears.png
  * Bump libdrm-dev build-dep to >= 2.0.2
  * Add libdrm cflags to the debian-dri config. This allows the build system
    to find drm.h
  * Make sure that libGl looks for the dri drivers in the proper location. Do
    this by setting the appropriate variables in the debian config
  * Re-add s390 and m68k to the USE_IEEE test in src/mesa/main/imports.h. This
    package seriously needs to store patches somewhere that are easy to find
    and re-apply.
  * Add patch from Cyril Brulebois to allow package to build on HURD, which
    lacks DRI and directfb. This includes not using lib-directfb in the
    build-depends for hurd-i386. It also creates a new debian config,
    debian-indirect, which is used when building for HURD. This config is
    invoked in the debian-dri config on hurd-i386. Thanks to Cyril Brulebois
    for the patch, Michael Banck, Michel Dänzer, and Samuel Thibault for
    input on an appropriate fix. (closes: #358065)

mesa (6.5.0.cvs.20060524-1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Upload mesa 6.5 cvs to unstable, because we need it for Xorg 7.1.
  * Upload with medium urgency instead of high, since this is a new
    upstream that should get some testing in unstable in spite of the
    multiple RC bugfixes.
  * Update debian/copyright with the full text of the SGI Free B and SGI
    MIT-style licenses in use in the package, and take a stab at
    cleaning up the list of paths and licenses.
    Closes: #368562.
  * Make mesa-common-dev Replaces: xlibosmesa-dev from sarge.
    Closes: #384057.
  * Fix libgl1-mesa-glx to not Provides: libgl1-mesa-dri, since it
    definitely doesn't provide DRI support and this Provides: breaks
    upgrades from sarge.  Closes: #384282.
  * debian/libgl1-mesa-swx11.shlibs: create a static shlibs file,
    because libOSMesa.so.6 is not provided by all implementations of
    libGL and so needs a separate shlibs declaration.  Also make
    libgl1-mesa-glx the default alternative instead of libgl1-mesa-swx11
    for consistency even when building against libgl1-mesa-swx11,
    because to the extent these are interchangeable (i.e., 99%...),
    there should be no reason to prefer one over the other -- and to the
    extent that they aren't interchangeable, it's wrong to list libgl1
    as an alternative dependency at all.  Closes: #386185.
  * Don't provide shlibs at all for libgl1-mesa-swx11-dbg; this is an
    unnecessary duplication of the existing libgl1-mesa-swx11 shlibs
    since packages should not really be linking against /usr/lib/debug/
    separately.
  * src/mesa/tnl/t_vb_render.c: Drop a pointless printf() in the
    RENDER_LINE macro, getting rid of copious debug output on console.
    Closes: #369895.
  * libgl1-mesa-swx11 has no reason to depend on libglu, anything that
    wants libglu will have its own dependency on it; drop this
    hard-coded dependency from debian/control.
  * Have libglu1-mesa-dev Provides: xlibmesa-glu-dev, since it's the
    successor to that package and xlibmesa-glu-dev is still referenced
    in a number of places and this makes for more reliable builds than
    depending on alternatives without requiring another dummy -dev
    package from xorg.
  * Replace references to Source-Version in debian/control with either 
    binary:Version or source:Version, depending on whether the
    relationship references an arch: any or arch: all package, making
    mesa binNMU-safe; add build-depends on dpkg-dev (>= 1.13.19) to
    ensure these substvars are available.

  * New upstream release.
  * Ack NMUs
  * debian/control: mesa-common-dev Replaces xlibmesa-gl-dev (<< 1:7)
    AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGEMENT.  The problem here is gratuitous package
    renames within a system that does not support them.  (closes:

  * debian/rules: modify shlibs file for the glide3 target to require glide3

    uses the glide target either he doesn't know what he is doing or he knows
    exactly what he is doing.  In the first case the package should not be

  * debian/rules: install include/GL/glx*.h in the common package.  (closes:
    bug#178562)
  * debian/rules: nasty hack to work arround libtool's idea of how libraries
    should be linked (closes: bug#178514)
  * debian/rules: even nastier hack.  Getting environment variables to
    percolate thru all the make calls isn't getting anywhere.
  * si-glu/Makefile.am: export only glu.* symbols
  * si-glu/Makefile.am: add -lm to link line
  * src/Makefile.am: god damm it.  If you use libm link to it!

mesa3 (3.4.2.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * So, here's the deal: the 3Dfx backend is going nowhere in 4.x and 5.x is
    just arround the corner.  Same thing for the GGI stuff.  In order to leave
    the people who need this stuff with _something_ to work with, I'll compile
    those targets out of the mesa3 source package and the mesa package will
    stuck to plain old X.

    and mesa3g-dev
  * debian/control: update GGI architectures, let's see what happens

  * GAAAAAAARGGH! src/X/xmesa1.c: horrible hack to use /etc/mesa/3dfx.conf
    if there's no MESA_GLX_FX environment variable defined.  I.  Hate.
    This.  I'll make a deal with you: you find another of these things,
    and you send me a nice tested patch.  I don't have a 3DFX card and I
    *HATE* uploading stuff I can't fully test. (closes: bug#94114)
  * debian/rules: use the new files
  * debian/rules: s/TMPDIR/DTEMPDIR/g
  * gl3DfxSetDitherModeEXT from Zephaniah (closes: bug#65860)
  * Disable GL_EXT_shared_texture_palette per default.  Patch looks funny,
    but I'll blindly trust Zephaniah.
  * Hmmm... I hope Zephaniah tested this, because it broke in a rather silly
    way at compile time.
