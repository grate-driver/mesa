mesa (6.4.1-0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU
  * Re-add dh_installdirs call to binary-indep target so that we get
    arch-specific dirs for the mesa-swx11-source package

    to get the app, which will translate over to our own xorg 7.0 plans.

mesa (6.4.1-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org> ]
  * debian/control: build-depend on xutils
  * include/GL/glx{int,proto,md,tokens}.h: missing upstream (closes: bug#326466)
  * debian/libgl1-mesa-dri-dev.install: install GLX include files here, too.
  * debian/rules: GLU and GLW don't have arch-specific targets.

  [ Daniel Stone <daniels@debian.org> ]
  * New upstream version, incorporating changes from Ubuntu 6.3 packaging.
  * Rename packages:
    - mesag3 -> libgl1-mesa-swrast
    - mesag-dev -> libgl1-mesa-swrast-dev
    - libgl1-mesa-dri -> libgl1-mesa
    - libgl1-mesa-dri-dev -> libgl1-mesa-dev
    - libgl1-mesa-dri still exists, but now contains the DRI modules only.
  * Drop dependency *from* mesa-common-dev on libgl1-mesa-dev and
    libglu1-mesa-dev; it should be the other way around. (closes: #336565)
  * Add Build-Depends on pkg-config to get flags from libdrm, and libexpat-dev
    for DRI configuration.  Break out xlibs-dev Build-Depends to the
    individual libraries required.
  * Bump libdrm-dev Build-Depends to >> 1.0.5, in order to get new
    via_drm.h to build the unichrome DRI driver.
  * Configs: pare DRI drivers down to a sensible set for each architecture.
  * Remove completely broken Glide target, which caused FTBFS.
  * Add mesa-swrast-source package, providing the source for the software
    rasteriser for libGLcore in the X server.
  * Drop tight libosmesa6 -> libgl1-mesa-swrast Depends, replace with
    shlibs:Depends.

  [ David Nusinow <dnusinow@debian.org> ]

  * Merge changes from Ubuntu version 6.4.1-0ubuntu1.
    (closes: #341479, #340168, #334742)
    + Add new files required by xorg-server GL build to mesa-swrast-source.
  * NMU to begin getting Xorg 7.0 in to Debian
  * Change libgl1-mesa-swrast Depends on libx11-6-dev to libx11-dev.
  * Change libgl1-mesa-swrast to be named libgl1-mesa-swx11
  * Change libgl1-mesa to be named libgl1-mesa-glx
  * mesa-swrast-src.install stop looking for the swx11 dir and look for swrast

mesa (6.3.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: build only whatever needs to be build according to
    debian/control.
  * debian/libdir.map: it's usr/lib/debug not usr/lib/dbg
  * debian/rules: select optimized targets for the current host architecture
    only (thanks Michel!)
  * debian/README.build: reword some of the directions, add more info.

mesa (6.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream
  * configs/debian-dri: new target
  * debian/control: add build-depends on libdrm-dev
  * debian/rules: pass SRC_DIRS instead of SUBDIRS on the command line.
    This allows for configurations to override the command line in a
    sane way.
  * configs/debian-dri: override SRC_DIRS
  * configs/debian: add -D_GNU_SOURCE (required by dri drivers)
  * debian/control, debian/rules: drop glide out of this package, it
    will be moved to the mesa-legacy package, forked from 6.2.1-7.
  * debian/drivers.map, debian/rules: take into account that some
    drivers have external components.
        + To be fixed: debian/drivers.map hardcodes locations
  * debian/control: libgl1-mesa-dri, libgl1-mesa-directfb: new drivers
  * dh_makeshlibs for libgl1-mesa-dri and libgl1-mesa-directfb
  * debian/control: priority is optional... again...

      + bin/mklib: add GNU/kFreeBSD, patch from Aurelien Jarno (closes:

mesa (6.2.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: big mess up, files are not being moved to their proper
    places.  I naively assumed that command-line options to debhelper
    commands would override DH_OPTIONS, that is, that having
    DH_OPTIONS=-i (as suggested in the documentation) would mean
    something like "use -i unless -p is passed on the command line".  It
    actually means "use -i in addition to -p passed on the command
    line", which does not make any sense, but is consistent with the
    wording in the documentation. (closes: bug#306499, bug#306918,
    bug#307095)

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sun, 01 May 2005 09:45:12 -0600

mesa (6.2.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: fix description to reflect the exact content and
    purpose of package (libosmesa-dev, mesag-dev).
  * debian/rules: DH_OPTIONS=-s added to binary-arch target.  (closes:
    bug#306091)

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Mar 2005 08:03:44 -0600

mesa (6.2.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: try to match the override file.  If mesa is "extra"
    (for whatever reason), all the packages should be extra.
  * debian/rules: quick workaround for left-over libGL.so in GLU -dev
    package.

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Mar 2005 19:35:34 -0600

mesa (6.2.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "thank you so much, I'm still voting against you" release.
  * debian/rules: correct artifact of me not having had a proper
    pbuilder environment to build stuff on and the repackaging from the
    previous release.  The -glu- and -glw- targets now explicitly depend
    on the matching -gl- target, and symlinks are placed in the build
    directories in order to actually have a libGL.so to make ld happy
    when creating the libraries.
  * debian/rules: uncomment dh_install :-\  There was a reason why I had
    commented that out...
  * First change closes: bug#298922
  * Second change closes: bug#300302, bug#300284, bug#300430
  * debian/control: "An X", whatever, I've been corrected multiple times
    in both ways (translators beware).  (closes: bug#300012)

 -- Marcelo E. Magallon <mmagallo@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Mar 2005 22:03:29 -0600

mesa (6.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "autobuilders, please please please don't hate me" release.
  * New upstream.
  * Repackage:
        + Fall prey to debhelper
        + Entries below this one preserved for historical reasons or
          sentimental value, pick as many as you want.  They bear NO
          relation to the actual packages!
  * configs/debian, configs/debian-debug, configs/debian-debug-i386,
    configs/debian-glide, configs/debian-glide-i386, configs/debian-i386,
    configs/debian-osmesa16, configs/debian-osmesa16-static,
    configs/debian-osmesa32, configs/debian-osmesa32-static,
    configs/debian-static, configs/debian-static-i386: new files.
  * configs/debian-sparc: Dave Miller confirmed that the sparc assembly
    files do work on Linux.  I don't know where to install the optimized
    libraries, so the file doesn't actually exist.  Please read
    debian/README.build if you want to have a sparc-optimized library.
  * debian/control: GGI and glide2 are gone.  glide is glide3.
  * debian/rules: modify shlibs file for the glide3 target to require glide3
    and only glide3 because that library exports functions not available in
    other libGLs.  Rationale: if someone is compiling a Debian package and
    uses the glide target either he doesn't know what he is doing or he knows
    exactly what he is doing.  In the first case the package should not be
    installable and in the second case the package requires this particular
    version.
  * debian/control: libgl1-mesa-glide3-dev does NOT provide a proper OpenGL
    development environment (see above).
  * PCR is bound to be wrong... *sigh*

mesa (6.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules: redid a bunch of stuff in order to support new build system
    without autoconf and automake stuff.  The next version is going to change
    this _again_.

mesa (5.0.0-5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload.

mesa (5.0.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "it's amazing how people pick severities" release
  * debian/control: mesa-common-dev conflicts with xlibmesa-dev.  Actually put
    dependency of mesa-common-dev on the mesa-*-dev packages to avoid having
    to track other libgl-dev packages popping up.  IMO this is less error
    prone.  You can't install mesa-common-dev without installing mesa-*-dev,
    and those packages conflict with other libgl-dev packages.  (closes:
    bug#177996)
  * Rename libglu1c102 to libglu1-mesa; the libglu1c102 is incorrent since
    this library does not export C++ functions.  Sorry about the mess.
  * Rename libglu1-dev to libglu1-mesa-dev to be consistent
  * debian/rules: use grep-dctrl to extract architectures from debian/control
  * debian/control: add grep-dctrl to build-depends
  * debian/shlibs.libglu: libglu1-mesa | libglu1
  * debian/rules: install include/GL/xmesa.h in /usr/include/GL/xmesa.h; I'm
    not 100% sure this is the right thing to do, but it's a niche so I don't
    think it will actually make trouble (closes: bug#148866)
  * debian/rules: install include/GL/glx*.h in the common package.  (closes:
    bug#178562)
  * debian/rules: nasty hack to work arround libtool's idea of how libraries
    should be linked (closes: bug#178514)
  * debian/rules: even nastier hack.  Getting environment variables to
    percolate thru all the make calls isn't getting anywhere.
  * si-glu/Makefile.am: export only glu.* symbols
  * si-glu/Makefile.am: add -lm to link line
  * src/Makefile.am: god damm it.  If you use libm link to it!
  * debian/control: mesa-common-dev depends on libglu1-mesa-dev to satisfy
    libgl-dev's requirements

    build-depends.  CVS says I didn't.  (closes: bug#176730)
  * debian/control, debian/rules: regenerate auto-stuff (closes: bug#176729)
  * debian/control, debian/rules: GCC C++ 3.2 transition (libglu1c102 -- ugly!)

  * debian/rules: some clean ups.
  * debian/control: add libglu1 packages
  * debian/control: Standards-Version: 3.5.8
  * debian/rules: Build Xt widgets (if you need this stuff, you need to depend
    on mesag-dev, libgl-dev is not enough)
  * debian/control, debian/rules: add mesa-common-dev package
  * debian/control, debian/rules: add osmesa packages.

mesa (3.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Redid patches.
  * Disabled building GGI target.  Someone with a good understanding of GGI
    needs to write a driver for mesa.  The old version doesn't cut it
    anymore.
  * Most makefiles won't work.  Copied them out of CVS.
  * src/Makefile.am: add -lm to library list.  (closes: bug#102717)
  * configure.in: adjust GLU's version info to match previous release.

mesa3 (3.4.2.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * So, here's the deal: the 3Dfx backend is going nowhere in 4.x and 5.x is
    just arround the corner.  Same thing for the GGI stuff.  In order to leave
    the people who need this stuff with _something_ to work with, I'll compile
    those targets out of the mesa3 source package and the mesa package will
    stuck to plain old X.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: strip out all the parts concerning to mesa3g
    and mesa3g-dev
  * debian/control: update GGI architectures, let's see what happens
  * debian/rules: special case alpha for stripping options.  Chris, did you
    ever figure out what the problem actually is? (closes: bug#99284)
  * debian/rules: hereby I decree that everything in etc is a conffile.  Die
    future bugs, die!.

  * GAAAAAAARGGH! src/X/xmesa1.c: horrible hack to use /etc/mesa/3dfx.conf
    if there's no MESA_GLX_FX environment variable defined.  I.  Hate.
    This.  I'll make a deal with you: you find another of these things,
    and you send me a nice tested patch.  I don't have a 3DFX card and I
    *HATE* uploading stuff I can't fully test. (closes: bug#94114)
  * debian/rules: use the new files
  * debian/rules: s/TMPDIR/DTEMPDIR/g
  * gl3DfxSetDitherModeEXT from Zephaniah (closes: bug#65860)
  * Disable GL_EXT_shared_texture_palette per default.  Patch looks funny,
    but I'll blindly trust Zephaniah.
  * Hmmm... I hope Zephaniah tested this, because it broke in a rather silly
    way at compile time.
